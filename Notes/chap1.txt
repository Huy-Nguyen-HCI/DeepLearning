Types of neurons:
	Input neuron: accept data from the program for the network.
		The program normally represents the input to a neural network as an array of floating-point vector (with length = # of input neurons)
		Input neurons do not have activation function. They are just placeholders.

	Output neuron: provide processed data from the network back to the program
	Hidden neurons receive input from and output to other neurons only.
	Bias neurons function like an input neuron that always produces the value of 1. Not connected to the previous layer.

	A single-hidden-layer neural network can function as a universal approximator. This network should function well if it has enough hidden neurons in a layer.

	Context neurons allow the neural network to maintain state.

Activation functions:
	Softmax activation function forces output of the neural network to represent the probability that the input falls into each of the classes.
	Every neuron in a layer has the same activation function. However, the layers themselves might have different activation functions. Layers are fully connected to the next layer.
